/*

suppose some num: 20 10 5 100 300 15 1222


x= 238;

x=20;

 find these num and explain the cases :



   ** for finding 238 we have to traverse all these case elements / thats why need more time
        more run time  etc..
        this called Wrost case : for liner search it explain : ‚àù(proposional sing) n


    ** Best case is 20 cZ 1st elements need little runtimne etc;


         Best case explain for liner  : constest



     **Avg case : (n(n-1)/2)/2;
                or  n+1/2
